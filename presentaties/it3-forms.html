							## Working with forms

				<section class="chapter">
							## Forms: good interaction design can make or break a modern web application
				</section>
				<section>
							## Forms revisited
							- We already learned about forms in IT1
							- You may use these examples and slides if you wish
							- Today we revisit forms with a few twists and a focus on the right structure
				</section>
				<section>
							## Forms
							- Important part of modern web applications: allow users to interact with systems
							- Forms are where visitors of a web page actually do something else than consume content
							- Forms enable visitors to do everything from filling out a contact form, write a contribution, enter payment information,...
							- Despite being very important, forms are often poorly designed and coded
							- Forms can be as simple as an e-mail address and a message field
							- Or they can be hugely complex, spanning multiple pages
				</section>
				<section>
							## Forms
							- Forms have traditionally been hard to style => often black box, browser decides
							- We can, however, style at least some parts of the appearance of form controls
							- We will learn how to style fieldsets, labels, text inputs, and buttons
							- In addition: how to style various form elements, including custom styling of checkboxes and select menus
				</section>
				<section>
							## Forms
							- Short and relatively simple forms are easiest to fill in when the form labels appear vertically above their associated form elements
							- Users can simply move down the form step by step, reading each label and completing the following form element
							- This method works well for short forms collecting relatively simple and predictable information such as contact details
							- It is also a very good baseline for viewing forms on smaller viewports such as mobile browsers.
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## Fieldsets and Legends help add structure and meaning to a form
				</section>
				<section>
							## Fieldsets
							- A fieldset is used for grouping related blocks of information
							- In the example, 3 fieldsets are used: one for the contact details, one for the comments, and one for the “Remember me” preference
				</section>
				<section>
							## Legends
							- Use a legend element to identify the purpose of a fieldset
							- Legends act a little like a fieldset’s heading
							- Usually appearing vertically centered over the top border of the fieldset and indented a little to the right
							- By default fieldsets are often rendered as having a double border
							- This slightly unusual appearance is implemented by different browsers in different ways
							- It seems to be a special case in the browser’s rendering engine, and throwing normal CSS properties at it to undo the odd positioning rarely has the effect you expect
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## Label elements help add structure and increase the usability and accessibility
				</section>
				<section>
							## Labels
							- Labels are used to add a meaningful and descriptive label to each form element
							- Clicking the label element will - in many browsers - cause the associated form element to gain focus
							- They increase form usability for people using assistive devices
							- Screen readers will correctly associate a form element with its label
							- Their users can also bring up a list of all the labels in a form, allowing them to audibly scan through the form
				</section>
				<section>
							## Labels
							Associating a label element with a form control can be done in one of two ways: either implicitly by nesting the form control inside the label element:

							``` html
								<label>Email <input name="comment-email" type="email"/></label>
							```

							Or explicitly by setting the for attribute of the label equal to the id attribute value of the associated form element:

							``` html
								<label for="comment-email">Email<label>
								<input name="comment-email" id="comment-email" type="email"/>
							```

							I prefer the explicit method.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Name and id attributes
							- Most form controls contain both a name attribute and an id attribute
							- The id attribute is required to create the association between the form input and the label
							- The name attribute is required so that the form data can be sent back to the server
							- The id and name don’t have to be the same, but it can be a handy convention to keep them identical when possible
				</section>
				<section>
							## For-attribute
							- Labels associated with form controls using the for attribute don’t need to be near those controls in the source code
							- They could be in a completely different part of the document
							- From a structural point of view, separating form controls from their labels should be avoided wherever possible
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## Input Fields and Text Areas
			  </section>
				<section>
							## Text Areas
							- Text areas are for typing in multiple lines of text, as in the comment field
							- The cols and rows attributes can be used to set a default size of the text area, mostly to indicate the approximate length of the expected content
							- We will be able to further style the textarea with CSS

							```html
								<textarea name="comment-text" id="comment-text" cols="20" rows="10"></textarea>
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Input Fields
							- The input element is a versatile form control
							- Default = single-line text input, but type attribute can change this to a variety of different form controls
							- Setting type="password" obscures the value, and type="checkbox" creates a checkbox
							- There are a lot of different values for the type attribute, many of them added in HTML5
							- Some are mostly variations of the text input but with special behavior: e.g. email, url, and search
							- Some types create different interface controls where supported: checkbox, radio, color, range, and file
							- Apart from type, there is also a whole host of attributes to use on the inputs, to declare the expected format
				</section>
				<section>
							## Input Fields
							- The different types of form inputs and their attributes are useful for automatic validation of forms
							- On devices with an onscreen keyboard, changing the type triggers the software keyboard to change its layout
							- If we add an e-mail field and a URL field with the correct types, the keyboard on smartphones and tablets will automatically adjust to make it easier to type in the correct value when we focus each field

							```html
								<input name="comment-author" id="comment-author" type="text" />
							```
