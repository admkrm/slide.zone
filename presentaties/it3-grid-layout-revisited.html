							## Revisiting?
				</section>
				<section>
							## Revisiting? Yes!
							- Yes, because mastering grid layout is one of the most important aspects of CSS
							- Yes, because specification is being updated to address some of the limitations that existed in the first version of Grid
							- Yes, because expert knowledge of Grid Layout will help you ace your IT3 exam
				</section>
				<section>
							## A short history of CSS Grid
							- CSS Grid arrived in 2017 with massive browser support
							- Much anticipated after it first appeared in 2012 in Internet Explorer alone
							- Designers could now dump floating as a layout technique. Lucky them, lucky you :-)
				</section>
				<section>
							## Support has risen to more than 94%
							![Grid support Can I Use](../img/it3-grid-support.png)
							##### https://caniuse.com/#search=grid
				</section>
				<section>
							## Support has risen to more than 94%
							- Was 90% at the end of 2018 when you learned to work with grid
							- Coming from 83% at the end of 2017
							- This means we can now finally drop @supports (grid-area: auto) {}
							- This means you can start using grid for the mobile version of your site
				</section>
				<section>
							## Level 2 of specification being implemented in Firefox
							![Subgrid support Can I Use](../img/it3-subgrid-support.png)
							##### https://caniuse.com/#search=grid

				</section>
				<section>
							## Level 2 of specification being implemented in Firefox
							- E.g. subgrids currently only marginally supported
							- We'll leave it untouched for now
							- Adoption might rise quickly in the near future
							- I'll keep you posted :-)
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## What again is Grid Layout?
				</section>
				<section>
							## Grid Layout?
							- The CSS grid layout Module defines a __two-dimensional grid__ layout system
							- Once a grid has been established on a containing element, __the direct children__ of that element can be placed into a flexible or fixed layout grid
							- The grid can be __redefined using media queries__
							- Grid is a very flexible module, so there are a number of ways to use it
				</section>
				<section>
							## Defining a grid
							A grid is defined using a new value of the display property, display: grid

							```html
							&lt;div class="wrapper">
								&lt;div class="box a">A&lt;/div>
								&lt;div class="box b">B&lt;/div>
								&lt;div class="box c">C&lt;/div>
								&lt;div class="box d">A&lt;/div>
								&lt;div class="box e">B&lt;/div>
								&lt;div class="box f">C&lt;/div>
							&lt;/div>
							```

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Describing rows and columns
							- Next, you describe what the grid looks like
							- Grids have rows and columns, which the CSS Grid Layout Module gives us properties to describe

							```CSS
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem;
								grid-template-rows: 10rem 10rem;
							}
							```
If we take a look at our page after we’ve declared a grid, we’ll see that the child elements have placed themselves on the grid.
They do this according to Grid’s auto-placement rules, which simply fill each cell in turn with a direct child of the grid container.

				</section>
				<section>
							## Terminology
							![Grid Terminology](../img/it3-terminology.png)
							##### Clockwise: column line 2, track between row lines 2 and 3, a grid cell, a grid area
				</section>
				<section>
							## The explicit and the implicit grid
							- In the example we created an __explicit__ grid: the child elements automatically slotted into the cells created by those grid tracks
							- If we don’t create enough cells, or place something outside of the explicit grid, Grid creates __implicit__ grid tracks for us
							- This means that we can remove the grid-template-rows property, and the items will still place themselves on the grid
							- The rows are then auto-sized. An auto-sized track will be large enough to fit the content.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Gaps between grid tracks
							We can do this by using the gap property, or individual properties of column-gap and row-gap

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem;
								gap: 10rem;
							}
				</section>
				<section>
							## Sizing implicit rows
							Auto-sized is the initial value of implicit tracks. We can however specify a size for them using the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties.

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem;
								grid-auto-rows: 10rem;
								gap: 10rem;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## The minmax() function
							In the previous example we could run into a situation where the content overflows the fixed-height track. We can achieve more flexibility by using the minmax() function for our track sizing. It allows us to pass in a minimum and a maximum value.

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem;
								grid-auto-rows:minmax(10rem, auto);
								gap: 10rem;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## The fr unit
							- Tracks can be created with any valid CSS length unit, or with percentages
							- You can also size tracks using the Grid-specific fr unit
							- This value represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container

							```css
							.wrapper {
								width: 60rem;
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr;
								grid-auto-rows:minmax(10rem, auto);
								gap: 10rem;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## The repeat() notation
							- With repeat(), we place comma-separated values between parentheses
							- The value before the comma stands for the number of times a pattern should repeat
							- The value after the comma refers to the pattern
							- We can repeat a single track value or a track listing

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## The auto-fill keyword
							- Say we want to have as many tracks (with a minimum size) as will fit into our grid container
							- This enables a responsive number of column tracks without relying on media queries to add breakpoints
							- This is achieved by using the auto-fill keyword instead of a number before the comma in our repeat notation

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(20rem, 1fr));
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Placing grid items by line number
							- In the previous example we auto-placed the grid items
							- We can of course place them manually using css
							- The simplest method to use is line-based placement

							```css
							.a {
								grid-row: 1 / 3;
								grid-column: 1 / 3;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Overlapping items on the grid
							- When placing items using lines, we can place an item into the same cell as another item
							- Items that are lower in the source display on top of items that come before them
							- we can use the z-index property to change the stacking order of items
				</section>
				<section>
							## Positioning using grid template areas
							Here we create named grid areas and use grid-template-areas to describe where on the grid they sit

							```css
							.a {grid-area: area-a;}
							.b {grid-area: area-b;}
							.c {grid-area: area-c;}
							.d {grid-area: area-d;}
							.e {grid-area: area-e;}
							.f {grid-area: area-f;}

							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
								grid-template-areas:
									"area-a area-b area-c"
									"area-d area-e area-f";
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Positioning using grid template areas
							Another possibility:

							```css
							.wrapper {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
								grid-template-areas:
									"area-a area-a area-a"
									".      area-b area-b"
									".      area-c area-d"
									"area-f area-f area-f"
									"area-e area-e area-e";
							}
				</section>

							## Grids within grids

				</section>
				<section>
							## Grids within grids
							- This is an important one
							- Understanding this 100% will enable you to look at a design and immediately see where you need one or more grids
							- Each web page may contain any number of grids
							- It is also possible that a grid element can become a grid in its own right: these grids we call nested grids
							- When designing a page: develop your ideas on paper first and determine where you will apply your grids
							- Don’t take the one mother-of-all-grids approach: you don’t need this kind of complexity
