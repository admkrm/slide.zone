							## Lesinhoud
							- Variabelen 
								- Wat zijn ze?
								- Naamgeving
							- Basisgegeventypes
								- how to display strings using l case, uppercase, and title case
								- werken met whitespace
								- working with integers and floats, and learned some of the ways you can work with numerical data
							- You also learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read.
				</section>

							## Variabelen
				</section>
				<section>
							## Basisvoorbeeld variabelen

							```Python
							boodschap = "Welkom bij Python programming!"
							print(boodschap)

							boodschap = "Python leren programmeren behoort tot het mooiste wat er bestaat"
							print(boodschap)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Variabelen
							- We’ve added a variable named message
							- Every variable is connected to a value, which is the information associated with that variable
							- You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time, and Python will always keep track of its current value
				</section>
				<section>
							## Naamgeving
							- Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number
							- Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names
							- Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names; that is, do not use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print
							- Variable names should be short but descriptive
							- The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase
				</section>
				<section>
							## Variabelen zijn labels
							- Variables are often described as boxes you can store values in
							- isn’t an accurate way to describe how variables are represented internally in Python
							- think of variables as labels that you can assign to values
							- You can also say that a variable references a certain value
				</section>
				<section>
							## Multiple assignment 
							You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line. This can help shorten your programs and make them easier to read; you’ll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers.
							You need to separate the variable names with commas, and do the same with the values, and Python will assign each value to its respectively positioned variable.

							```Python
							x, y, z = 0, 0, 0
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Constants

							A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed:
							
							```Python
							MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
							```
							
							When you want to treat a variable as a constant in your code, make the name of the variable all capital letters.
				</section>
				<section>
							## comments
							A comment allows you to write notes in English within your programs.
							In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following a hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter.
							
							# Say hello to everyone. 
							print("Hello Python people!")

							## Basisgevenstypes
				</section>
				<section>
							## Strings
							- A string is a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings
								- "Dit is een string." 
								- 'Dit is ook een string.'
							- This flexibility allows you to use quotes and apostrophes within your strings:
								- 'I told my friend, "Python is my favorite language!"'
								- "One of Python's strengths is its diverse and supportive community."
				</section>

							## Changing Case in a String with Methods

							```Python
							name = "Ada Lovelace"
							print(name.title())
							print(name.upper())
							print(name.lower())
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Changing Case in a String with Methods
							The method title() appears after the variable in the print() call. A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, because methods often need additional information to do their work. That information is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t need any additional information, so its parentheses are empty.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Changing Case in a String with Methods
							The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. Many times you won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to display the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense for each string.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Using variables in a string
							To insert a variable’s value into a string, place the letter f immediately before the opening quotation mark. Put braces around the name or names of any variable you want to use inside the string. Python will replace each variable with its value when the string is displayed. These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Python formats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with its value.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Using variables in a string
							```Python
							first_name = "ada"
							last_name = "lovelace"
							full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
							message = f"Hello, {full_name.title()}!"
							print(message)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines
							In programming, whitespace refers to any nonprinting character, such as spaces, tabs, and end- of-line symbols. You can use whitespace to organize your output so it’s easier for users to read.
							- To add a tab to your text, use the character combination \t
							- To add a newline in a string, use the character combination \n:
							- You can also combine tabs and newlines in a single string. The string "\n\t" tells Python to move to a new line, and start the next line with a tab.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or NewLines

							```Python
							print("\tPython")
							print("Languages:\nPython\nC\nJavaScript")
							print("Languages:\n\tPython\n\tC\n\tJavaScript")
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Stripping whitespace
							Extra whitespace can be confusing in your programs. It’s important to think about whitespace, because often you’ll want to compare two strings to determine whether they are the same.
							Python makes it easy to eliminate extraneous whitespace from data that people enter.
							Python can look for extra whitespace on the right and left sides of a string.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Stripping whitespace

							```Python
							favorite_language = 'python '
							favorite_language.rstrip()
							favorite_language
							favorite_language = favorite_language.rstrip() >>> favorite_language
							favorite_language.lstrip()
							favorite_language.strip()
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Gehele getallen
							Python calls ... integers
							- You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python.
							- Python uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents
							- Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multiple operations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify the order of operations so Python can evaluate your expression in the order you specify.
							- The spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions; it simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that have priority when you’re reading through the code.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Gehele getallen

							```Python
							2 + 3
							3 - 2
							2 * 3
							3 / 2
							3 ** 2
							2 + 3*4
							(2 + 3) * 4
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Decimale getallen
							Python calls any number with a decimal point a float. This term is used in most programming languages, and it refers to the fact that a decimal point can appear at any position in a number.
							For the most part, you can use decimals without worrying about how they behave.
							But be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number of decimal places in your answer:
				</section>
				<section>
							## Decimale getallen

							```Python
							0.1 + 0.1
							0.2 + 0.2
							2 * 0.1
							2 * 0.2
							0.2 + 0.1
							3 * 0.1
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Gehele en decimale getallen
							When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a whole number, you’ll always get a float:
							If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a float as well:
							Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if the output is a whole number.
							When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores to make large numbers more readable:
				</section>

							## Gehele en decimale getallen


							```Python
							4/2
							1 + 2.0
							2 * 3.0
							3.0 ** 2
							universe_age = 14_000_000_000
							```
