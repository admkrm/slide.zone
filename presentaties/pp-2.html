				<section>
							## Wat zijn lijsten?
							you’ll learn what lists are and how to start working with the elements in a list. Lists allow you to store sets of information in one place, whether you have just a few items or millions of items. Lists are one of Python’s most powerful features
							A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of all the people in your family. You can put anything you want into a list, and
							the items in your list don’t have to be related in any particular way. Because a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names.
							In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas.

							learned what lists are and how to work with the individual items in a list. You learned how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. You learned to sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes. You also learned how to find the length of a list and how to avoid index errors when you’re working with lists.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Basisvoorbeeld lijsten

							```Python
							bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
							message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}."
							print(message)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Accessing elements in a list
							If you ask Python to print a list, Python returns its representation of the list, including the square brackets:
							Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets.
							Python considers the first item in a list to be at position 0, not position 1. The second item in a list has an index of 1.
							Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. By asking for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list:
							The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Basisvoorbeeld lijsten

							```Python
							print(bicycles[0].title())
							print(bicycles[1]) 
							print(bicycles[3])
							message = f"My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}."
							```

							## Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
				</section>
				<section>
							## Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
							Most lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Modifying Elements in a List
							The syntax for modifying an element is similar to the syntax for accessing an element in a list. To change an element, use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the new value you want that item to have.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Modifying Elements in a list

							```Python
							motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Adding Elements to a List

							Python provides several ways to add new data to existing lists.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Appending Elements to the End of a List

							The append() method makes it easy to build lists dynamically. For example, you can start with an empty list and then add items to the list using a series of append() calls.

							```Python
							motorcycles.append('ducati') 
							print(motorcycles)

							motorcycles = [] 
							motorcycles.append('honda') 
							motorcycles.append('yamaha') 
							motorcycles.append('suzuki')
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Inserting Elements into a List
							You can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert() method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and the value of the new item.

							```Python
							motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
							motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati') 
							print(motorcycles)
							```

							The insert() method opens a space at position 0 and stores the value 'ducati' at that location. This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right
				</section>
				<section>
							## Removing elements from a list: del

							If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can use the del statement.

							```Python
							motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
							del motorcycles[0] 
							print(motorcycles)
							del motorcycles[1]
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Removing elements from a list: the pop() Method

							The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work with that item after removing it.

							```Python
							motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
							popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()
							print(motorcycles)
							print(popped_motorcycle)
							last_owned = motorcycles.pop() 
							print(f"The last motorcycle I owned was a {last_owned.title()}.")
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Popping Items from any Position in a List

							You can use pop() to remove an item from any position in a list by including the index of the item you want to remove in parentheses.

							```Python
							first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)
							print(f"The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.")
							```

							Remember that each time you use pop(), the item you work with is no longer stored in the list.

							when you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an item as you remove it, use the pop() method.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Removing an Item by Value

							Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method.

							```Python
							motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']
							motorcycles.remove('ducati') 
							print(motorcycles)

							too_expensive = 'ducati'
							motorcycles.remove(too_expensive)
							print(f"\nA {too_expensive.title()} is too expensive for me.")
							```

							You can also use the remove() method to work with a value that’s being removed from a list.

							The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed.

							## Organizing a list
				</section>
				<section>
							## Organizing a list

							you’ll frequently want to present your information in a particular order. Sometimes you’ll want to preserve the original order of your list, and other times you’ll want to change the original order. Python provides a number of different ways to organize your lists, depending on the situation.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() Method

							Python’s sort() method makes it relatively easy to sort a list. Imagine we have a list of cars and want to change the order of the list to store them alphabetically. (let’s assume that all the values in the list are lowercase.)

							```Python
							cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
							cars.sort()
							cars.sort(reverse=True) 
							print(cars)
							```

							The sort() method, shown at u, changes the order of the list permanently. The cars are now in alphabetical order, and we can never revert to the original order

							You can also sort this list in reverse alphabetical order by passing the argument reverse=True to the sort() method.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function

							To maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you can use the sorted() function. The sorted() function lets you display your list in a particular order but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list.

							```Python
							print("\nHere is the sorted list:") 
							print(sorted(cars))
							print("\nHere is the original list again:") 
							print(cars)
							```

							The sorted() function can also accept a reverse=True argument if you want to display a list in reverse alphabetical order.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Printing a List in Reverse Order

							To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method.
							
							If we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to when we owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse chronological order:

							```Python
							cars.reverse()
							print(cars)
							```

							The reverse() method changes the order of a list permanently, but you can revert to the original order anytime by applying reverse() to the same list a second time.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Finding the Length of a List

							You can quickly find the length of a list by using the len() function. The list in this example has four items, so its length is 4:

							```Python
							cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
							len(cars)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists
							An index error means Python can’t find an item at the index you requested. If an index error occurs in your program, try adjusting the index you’re asking for by one. Then run the program again to see if the results are correct.
							Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list you use the index -1. This will always work, even if your list has changed size since the last time you accessed it:

							```Python
							print(motorcycles[-1])
							````
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## Werken met _lists_
				</section>
				<section>
							## Een _list_ doorlopen
							You’ll often want to run through all entries in a list, performing the same task with each item.
							When you want to do the same action with every item in a list, you can use Python’s for loop.

							```Python
							magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']
							for magician in magicians:
								print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!")
								print(f"I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\n")
							```

							These naming conventions (for item in list_of_items:) can help you follow the action being done on each item within a for loop. Using singular and plural names can help you identify whether a section of code is working with a single element from the list or the entire list.

							You can also write as many lines of code as you like in the for loop.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Making Numerical Lists
							Lists are ideal for storing sets of numbers, and Python provides a variety of tools to help you work efficiently with lists of numbers.

							Python’s range() function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers. For example, you can use the range() function to print a series of numbers like this:

							```Python
							for value in range(1, 5):
								print(value)
							```

							In this example, range() prints only the numbers 1 through 4. This is another result of the off-by-one behavior you’ll see often in programming languages.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Using range() to Make a List of Numbers

							If you want to make a list of numbers, you can convert the results of range() directly into a list using the list() function. When you wrap list() around a call to the range() function, the output will be a list of numbers.

							```Python
							numbers = list(range(1, 6)) 
							print(numbers)
							```

							We can also use the range() function to tell Python to skip numbers in a given range. If you pass a third argument to range(), Python uses that value as a step size when generating numbers.

							```Python
							even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2)) 
							print(even_numbers)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Using range() to make a list of numbers

							You can create almost any set of numbers you want to using the range() function.

							```Python
							squares = []
							for value in range(1, 11):
								square = value ** 2 
								squares.append(square)
							```

							more concisely, omit the temporary variable square and append each new value directly to the list:

							```Python
							squares = [] 
							for value in range(1,11):
								squares.append(value**2)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Simple Statistics with a List of Numbers

							A few Python functions are helpful when working with lists of numbers. For example, you can easily find the minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of numbers:

							```Python
							digits = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
							min(digits) 0
							max(digits) 9
							sum(digits)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## List Comprehensions

							A list comprehension allows you to generate this same list in just one line of code.A list comprehension combines the for loop and the creation of new elements into one line, and automatically appends each new element.

							```Python
							squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)] 
							```

							It takes practice to write your own list comprehensions, but you’ll find them worthwhile once you become comfortable creating ordinary lists. When you’re writing three or four lines of code to generate lists and it begins to feel repetitive, consider writing your own list comprehensions

							## Working with part of a list
				</section>
				<section>
							## Een List slicen
							You can also work with a specific group of items in a list, which Python calls a slice.
							To make a slice, you specify the index of the first and last elements you want to work with. As with the range() function, Python stops one item before the second index you specify. To output the first three elements in a list, you would request indices 0 through 3, which would return elements 0, 1, and 2.
							If you omit the first index in a slice, Python automatically starts your slice at the beginning of the list
							A similar syntax works if you want a slice that includes the end of a list.
							Recall that a negative index returns an element a certain distance from the end of a list
							You can include a third value in the brackets indicating a slice. If a third value is included, this tells Python how many items to skip between items in the specified range.

							```Python
							players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
							print(players[0:3])
							print(players[1:4])
							print(players[:4])
							print(players[2:])
							print(players[-3:])
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Looping through a slice
							You can use a slice in a for loop if you want to loop through a subset of the elements in a list.

							```Python
							players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'florence', 'eli']
							print("Here are the first three players on my team:")
							for player in players[:3]:
								print(player.title())
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Looping through a slice
							Slices are very useful in a number of situations. For instance, when you’re creating a game, you could add a player’s final score to a list every time that player finishes playing. You could then get a player’s top three scores by sorting the list in decreasing order and taking a slice that includes just the first three scores. When you’re working with data, you can use slices to process your data in chunks of a specific size. Or, when you’re building a web application, you could use slices to display information in a series of pages with an appropriate amount of information on each page.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Copying a List
							Often, you’ll want to start with an existing list and make an entirely new list based on the first one. To copy a list, you can make a slice that includes the entire original list by omitting the first index and the second index ([:]).

							```Python
							my_foods = ['pizza', 'falafel', 'carrot cake']
							friend_foods = my_foods[:]
							my_foods.append('cannoli')
							friend_foods.append('ice cream')
							print("My favorite foods are:")
							print(my_foods)
							print("\nMy friend's favorite foods are:")
							print(friend_foods)
							```

							here’s what happens when you try to copy a list without using a slice. so now both variables point to the same list.

							```Python
							# This doesn't work: 
							friend_foods = my_foods
							```
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
							## Tuples
				</section>
				<section>
							## Tuples
							sometimes you’ll want to create a list of items that cannot change. Tuples allow you to do just that. Python refers to values that cannot change as immutable, and an immutable list is called a tuple.

							When compared with lists, tuples are simple data structures. Use them when you want to store a set of values that should not be changed throughout the life of a program.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Defining a tuple
							A tuple looks just like a list except you use parentheses instead of square brackets. Once you define a tuple, you can access individual elements by using each item’s index, just as you would for a list.

							```Python
							dimensions = (200, 50) 
							print(dimensions[0]) 
							print(dimensions[1])
							```
							Als je een element wil veranderen:
							TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

							Tuples are technically defined by the presence of a comma; the parentheses make them look neater and more readable. If you want to define a tuple with one element, you need to include a trailing comma: my_t = (3,)
				</section>
				<section>
							## Looping through all values in a tuple
							You can loop over all the values in a tuple using a for loop, just as you did with a list:

							```Python
							dimensions = (200, 50)
							for dimension in dimensions:
    							print(dimension)
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Writing over a Tuple
							Although you can’t modify a tuple, you can assign a new value to a variable that represents a tuple. So if we wanted to change our dimensions, we could redefine the entire tuple:

							```Python
							dimensions = (200, 50)
							for dimension in dimensions:
    							print(dimension)
							
							dimensions = (400, 100)
							print("\nModified dimensions:")
							for dimension in dimensions:
								print(dimension)
							```
