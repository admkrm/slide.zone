							## Up-front
							- Advanced Front-end Coding (AFEC) is an open space for experimentation
							- Don't worry about the exam: there is none ;-)
							- I will evaluate both your process and your work
							- Even if the work has not been a 100% success, the process might have been interesting
							- Make sure you've had an interesting process, and perhaps also a few interesting little experiments...
							- ... and we are cool ;-)
							- Please don't give up!
				</section>
				<section>
							## "Required" knowledge
							- HTML, CSS
							- Basics of JavaScript
							- Basics of Node (https://nodejs.org)
							- Basics of GitHub (https://github.com)
							- Basics of working with the terminal
							- Basics to writing Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org/)

							(Again, don't worry. No matter what your level of expertise, we'll find something for you to do)

							## Static Site Generators ?

							"The typical CMS driven website works by building each page on-demand, fetching content from a database and running it through a template engine. This means each page is assembled from templates and content on each request to the server."

							"For most sites this is completely unnecessary overhead and only adds complexity, performance problems and security issues. After all, by far the most websites only change when the content authors or their design team makes changes."

							"A __Static Site Generator__ takes a different approach and generates all the pages of the website once when there's actually changes to the site. This means there's no moving parts in the deployed website. Caching gets much easier, performance goes up and static sites are far more secure."
