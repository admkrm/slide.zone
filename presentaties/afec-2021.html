							## Isn't this a developer's job? I am a designer
							Let these hard truths sink in a little bit...
							- UI designers need to get involved in code too (if they care about building interfaces)
							- If your only output is a set of mockups or wireframes you are not building a proper UI: you will produce static interfaces
							- A digital interface designer needs to produce, at some level, the code of their own UI's
							- The less code you can produce, the more limited your UI's will be
							- Of course there is a point where a UI designer collaborates with a front-end developer. But if you can't code yourself: loss of visibility and control over key aspects of the user interaction
