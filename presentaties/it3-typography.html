							# Information Technology 3
							## Typesetting for the Web
							#### Kristof Michiels
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
						## Typesetting for the web is an art
				</section>
				<section>
							## The importance of typesetting
							- Good typesetting makes the act of reading recede into the background
							- Skillful typesetting allows readers to absorb information quickly
							- Good typesetting is often invisible
							- As a web designer, you should be sensitive to how text is used in design examples
				</section>
				<section>
							## Typography-driven design?
							- You start your design from text
							- It might be looked at as the secret cornerstone of flexible, responsive design
							- This week we'll make a web page wherein typography plays an important role
				</section>
				<section>
							## The nature of the text
							- The nature of the text is really important
							- You have to care about the text in order to make a good web design out of it
							- In real-world projects: getting good text copy will sometimes be a problem
							- As a general rule, if you don’t have enough text, ask for more
							- If it’s not the final version, ask for an update
							- If the text is going to change all the time, like news, find some representative example text
							- Once you "KNOW" your text, do contextual, visual research. Understand how texts of this nature are placed in a web context. Once you know these rules, apply or break them
				</section>
				<section>
							## Clean text and declutter
							- When you have selected your text, first clean it up!
							- Remove tabs, indents, and any other invisible characters that do not belong in the text
							- Eliminate any line breaks, hyphens in words, ... within running text, which are often the result of copy-and-paste problems
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
						## Marking up your texts
				</section>
				<section>
							## Mark the text up
							- Finally, mark up the elements of the text—paragraphs, headings, lists, block quotes, and so on—as well as any strings that need emphasis
							- Here your HTML-skills come into play
							- Don't forget that markup is the most basic and possibly the most important typographic decision we make
							- Think of it as invisible composition: markup
							- It’s our core means of establishing hierarchy, patterns, and meaning
				</section>
				<section>
							## Refresher: reset default styles
							- Most browsers and user agents ship with default styles
							- To counter this, use reset stylesheet
							- Eric Meyer has advocated the use of reset stylesheets since 2007
							- We are going to use his latest version as a starting point for our exercise: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
							- A reset stylesheet puts the focus on HTML elements rather than on browser behavior
				</section>
				<section>
						## Framing the composition
						- Framing compositions is different for the web than for traditional media
						- We don't have control over the myriad of screens our text will be read on
						- First, we need to make sure readers see our composition at its actual size on any device, without any artificial scaling
				</section>
				<section>
						## Framing the composition
						- We do this with the viewport metatag
						- It tells the browser to fit the width of our layout to the width of a person’s device
						- A reliable building block for typesetting: default font size
						- You can set the font-size to 100%, or for example to 62.5%, which makes an em or rem 10px in size

						```html
						&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
						```

						``` css
							:root {
								font-size: 62.5%; /* makes a rem = 10px */}
						```
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
						## Webfonts
				</section>
				<section>
						## Getting to webfonts
						- Webfonts aren’t hard to find
						- Places like Adobe Typekit or Fontstand are better than Google Fonts, but cost money
						- Repositories of free and open-source fonts—even something as convenient as Google Fonts—have significantly fewer choices for text use
						- In many of these fonts, character sets are incomplete, random glyphs look wrong, critical features are missing, spacing is sloppy, and styles like bold and italic are either nonexistent or incongruous with the main style
						- Design pros will immediately spot this :-/

					## Getting webfonts
					- Fonts you select at Adobe Typekit are added to a "kit" that you publish and connect to your web project. Because Typekit hosts the fonts and offers a standard licensing agreement, there’s not really anything you need to "get."
					- Google fonts also offers an easy way to link to the selected fonts
					- If you download or purchase a webfont, you will get the files: WOFF, or preferably WOFF2, as well as a copy of your End User License Agreement (EULA) specifying that web use is ok
				</section>
				<section>
					## Using webfonts
					- You will link this cloud fonts in the head part of your HTML file, and these services will tell you how
					- You will need to add the downloaded fonts to your css file
					- The CSS @font-face rule ( font files to stylesheets by defining fonts like so:

					``` css
						@font-face {
								font-family: "Source Sans Pro";
								font-weight: 400;
								font-style: normal;
								font-stretch: normal;
								src: url("SourceSansPro-Regular.woff2") format("woff2");
						}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Declaring the fonts

					Now that your font files are online and defined in your CSS, you can use them in declarations like this:

					```css
						p {
								font-family: "Source Sans Pro";
								font-size: 1.5rem;
						}

						p strong {
								font-style: bold;
						}
					```
				</section>
				<section class="chapter">
					## Designing your page
				</section>
				<section>
					## Creating text-based layouts
					- Everything matters here: the fonts you select (do they match?), the horizontal margins, the vertical margins, the line heights, ...
					- Everything needs to be in balance
					- There is no shortcut: you have to experiment and work hard to make it work
				</section>
				<section>
					## Don't make the text too wide: limit the width

					``` css
						:root {
								font-size: 62.5%;}

						body {
								font-family: sans-serif;
								line-height: 1.5rem;
								font-size: 1.3rem;}

						main {
								width: 40rem; /* or max-width */}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Limiting the width of your text
					Of course CSS Grid Layout can also take care of this for you
					``` css
						:root {
								font-size: 62.5%;}

						body {
								font-family: sans-serif;
								line-height: 1.5rem;
								font-size: 1.3rem;}

						main {
								display: grid;
								grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
								max-width: 80rem;}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Limiting the width of your text
					- For the exercise I would recommend you also experiment with vw and vh
					- 100vw or viewport width equals the available width of the viewport, 50vw half of that, ...
					- 100vh or viewport width equals the available width of the viewport, 50vh half of that, ...
					- You also have vmin (the smallest, be it vw or vh) and vmax (the largest, be it vw or vh)

					``` css
						body {
								width: 70vw;
								height: 100vh;}

						main {
								width: 50vmin;
								height: 40vmax;}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Adjust line-spacing accordingly
					Adjusting line-height in your css can make or break a design.
					It is really important and something you need to experiment with
					``` css
						p {
								font-size: 1.5rem;
								line-height: 3rem;
						}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Margins
					- If you’re using a margin between paragraphs, try a margin-bottom equivalent to half of the line height,
					or try a small number from your modular scale
					- Whichever value you choose, use rem units so that vertical margins relate to the body-text font size
					- And set margins in a single direction on every element: https://csswizardry.com/2012/06/single-direction-margin-declarations/

					``` css
						h1 {
								margin-bottom: 3rem;}

						p {
								margin-bottom: 1.5rem;}
					```

				</section>
				<section>
					## Different sizes for different screen widths
					Don't forget that by using @media queries, you can change the font sizes of your designs
					``` css
							:root {
								font-size: 70%;
							}

							@media screen and (min-width: 70rem) {
									:root {
										font-size: 62.5%;
									}
							}
					```
				</section>
				<section>
					## Experiment with responsive typography

					If you use vw for font-size then the font-size will adapt itself to the available width

					``` css

							h1 {
								font-size: 5vw;
							}
					```

					## Your assignment for this week
				</section>
				<section>
					## Exercise
					- You will write a biography page (1 page, scroll-down style) for one of the following artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Pieter Bruegel, Antoon Van Dyck, Hieronymus Bosch
					- The page will consist only of text, no images
					- You play with type, color, size, grid layout (+ positioning), space, CSS transitions & animations
					- You will select at least 3 Adobe fonts that you will use appropriately on this page
					- Pay attention to all the stuff we have seen today: details matter
					- Your site needs to be typography (and mobile) first, and should be responsive
				</section>
				<section>
							## Use your imagination
							![Adobe fonts](../img/it3-fonts-5.png)
							##### No dull text please => make a text sculpture. Try letting the artist's style shine through in your design
