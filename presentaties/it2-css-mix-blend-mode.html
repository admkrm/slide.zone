				<section>
							## mix-blend-mode
							- Defines how an element’s content should blend with its background
							- This means that any images or text, borders or headings will be influenced by this property

							```CSS
							.blend {
  							mix-blend-mode: exclusion;
							}
							```
				</section>
				<section>
							## Waarden
							-initial: the default setting of the property that does not set a blend mode.
							- inherit: an element will inherit the blend mode from its parent element.
							-	unset: removes the current blend mode from an element.
							- <blend-mode>: this is the attribute of one of the blend modes beneath:
							- normal: this attribute applies no blending whatsoever.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Waarden
							- multiply: the element is multiplied by the background and replaces the background color. The resulting color is always as dark as the background.
							- screen: multiplies the background and the content then complements the result. This will result in content which is brighter than the background-color.
							- overlay: multiplies or screens the content depending on the background color. This is the inverse of the hard-light blend mode.
							- darken: the background is replaced with the content where the content is darker, otherwise it is left as it was.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Waarden
							- lighten: the background is replaced with the content where the content is lighter.
							- color-dodge: this attribute brightens the background color to reflect the color of the content.
							- color-burn: this darkens the background to reflect the content’s natural color.
							- hard-light: depending on the color of the content this attribute will screen or multiply it.
							- soft-light: depending on the color of the content this will darken or lighten it.
							- difference: this subtracts the darker of the two colors from the lightest color.
				</section>
				<section>
							## Waarden
							- exclusion: similar to difference but with lower contrast.
							- hue: creates a color with the hue of the content combined with the saturation and luminosity of the background.
							- saturation: creates a color with saturation of the content combined with the hue and luminosity of the background.
							- color: creates a color with the hue and saturation of the content and the luminosity of the background.
							- luminosity: creates a color with the luminosity of the content and the hue and saturation of the background. This is the inverse of the color attribute.
