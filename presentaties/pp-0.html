							## Avoiding Indentation Errors

							Python uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is related to the rest of the program. In the previous examples, the lines that printed messages to individual magicians were part of the for loop because they were indented. Python’s use of indentation makes code very easy to read. Basically, it uses whitespace to force you to write neatly formatted code with a clear visual structure. In longer Python programs, you’ll notice blocks of code indented at a few different levels. These indentation levels help you gain a general sense of the overall program’s organization.
							
							As you begin to write code that relies on proper indentation, you’ll need to watch for a few common indentation errors. For example, people sometimes indent lines of code that don’t need to be indented or forget to indent lines that need to be indented. Seeing examples of these errors now will help you avoid them in the future and correct them when they do appear in your own programs.

							Python programmers have agreed on a number of styling conventions to ensure that everyone’s code is structured in roughly the same way. Once you’ve learned to write clean Python code, you should be able to understand the overall structure of anyone else’s Python code, as long as they follow the same guidelines. If you’re hoping to become a professional programmer at some point, you should begin following these guidelines as soon as possible to develop good habits.

							## The style guide

							When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). One of the oldest PEPs is PEP 8, which instructs Python programmers on how to style their code. PEP 8 is fairly lengthy, but much of it relates to more complex coding structures than what you’ve seen so far.

							The Python style guide was written with the understanding that code is read more often than it is written. You’ll write your code once and then start reading it as you begin debugging. When you add features to a program, you’ll spend more time reading your code. When you share your code with other programmers, they’ll read your code as well.

							Given the choice between writing code that’s easier to write or code that’s easier to read, Python programmers will almost always encourage you to write code that’s easier to read. The following guidelines will help you write clear code from the start.

							## Indentation

							PEP 8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. Using four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of indentation on each line.

							In a word processing document, people often use tabs rather than spaces to indent. This works well for word processing documents, but the Python interpreter gets confused when tabs are mixed with spaces. Every text editor provides a setting that lets you use the Ta B key but then converts each tab to a set number of spaces. You should definitely use your Ta B key, but also make sure your editor is set to insert spaces rather than tabs into your document.

							Mixing tabs and spaces in your file can cause problems that are very difficult to diagnose. If you think you have a mix of tabs and spaces, you can convert all tabs in a file to spaces in most editors.

							## Line length
							Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than 80 characters. Historically, this guideline developed because most computers could fit only 79 characters on a single line in a terminal window. Currently, people can fit much longer lines on their screens, but other reasons exist to adhere to the 79-character standard line length. Professional programmers often have several files open on the same screen, and using the standard line length allows them to see entire lines in two or three files that are open side by side onscreen. PEP 8 also recommends that you limit all of your comments to 72 characters per line, because some of the tools that generate automatic documentation for larger projects add formatting characters at the beginning of each commented line.

							The PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone, and some teams prefer a 99-character limit. Don’t worry too much about line length in your code as you’re learning, but be aware that people who are working collaboratively almost always follow the PEP 8 guidelines. Most editors allow you to set up a visual cue, usually a vertical line on your screen, that shows you where these limits are.

							## Blank lines
							To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. You should use blank lines to organize your files, but don’t do so excessively. By following the examples provided in this book, you should strike the right balance. For example, if you have five lines of code that build a list, and then another three lines that do something with that list, it’s appropriate to place a blank line between the two sections. However, you should not place three or four blank lines between the two sections. Blank lines won’t affect how your code runs, but they will affect the readability of your code. The Python interpreter uses horizontal indentation to interpret the meaning of your code, but it disregards vertical spacing.

							## Other style guidelines
							PEP 8 has many additional styling recommendations, but most of the guidelines refer to more complex programs than what you’re writing at this point. As you learn more complex Python structures, I’ll share the relevant parts of the PEP 8 guidelines.
